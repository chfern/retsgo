# QuickStart
## Prerequisites :
- Make sure you have go, and the standard packages installed in your system. For guidance, head to [golang guide](https://golang.org/)
- Configure $GOPATH in your system. Try running `echo $GOPATH` (unix) in your terminal  
  It should print out something like /path/to/the/goworkspace

## Quick Start :
Get retsgo package  
`go get github.com/fernandochristyanto/retsgo`

Run `retsgo -v`  
it should print out the version number (if it does not, try restarting your terminal)

Create a new directory to hold your project, e.g:   
`mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/mygithubusername/newprojectname`

Generate a new project  
`retsgo newproject github.com/mygithubusername/newprojectname`
